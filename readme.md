#Python Practice Problems

This repo contains some sample Python problems pulled from various sources of Python courses.
The repo is divded by the general difficulty of the problem. Each program will begin by first re-stating the problem, then followed by my attempt at solving the problem.
Problems include all variety of topics such as numerical, object-oriented, data sets, testing/debugging, generators, etc.
Solutions will be optimized to the best of my ability.
This is a journey into my first understanding of code, once I feel comfortable with Python the goal is to learn Java and C++.

Let's see how far we can go.
